<objective>
Capture an idea, task, or issue that surfaces during a GSD session as a structured todo for later work.

Enables "thought → capture → continue" flow without losing context or derailing current work.
</objective>

<context>
@.planning/STATE.md
</context>

<process>

<step name="ensure_directory">
```bash
mkdir -p .planning/todos/pending .planning/todos/done
```
</step>

<step name="check_existing_areas">
```bash
ls .planning/todos/pending/*.md 2>/dev/null | xargs -I {} grep "^area:" {} 2>/dev/null | cut -d' ' -f2 | sort -u
```

Note existing areas for consistency in infer_area step.
</step>

<step name="extract_content">
**With arguments:** Use as the title/focus.
- `/gsd:add-todo Add auth token refresh` → title = "Add auth token refresh"

**Without arguments:** Analyze recent conversation to extract:
- The specific problem, idea, or task discussed
- Relevant file paths mentioned
- Technical details (error messages, line numbers, constraints)

Formulate:
- `title`: 3-10 word descriptive title (action verb preferred)
- `problem`: What's wrong or why this is needed
- `solution`: Approach hints or "TBD" if just an idea
- `files`: Relevant paths with line numbers from conversation
</step>

<step name="infer_area">
Infer area from file paths:

| Path pattern | Area |
|--------------|------|
| `src/api/*`, `api/*` | `api` |
| `src/components/*`, `src/ui/*` | `ui` |
| `src/auth/*`, `auth/*` | `auth` |
| `src/db/*`, `database/*` | `database` |
| `tests/*`, `__tests__/*` | `testing` |
| `docs/*` | `docs` |
| `.planning/*` | `planning` |
| `scripts/*`, `bin/*` | `tooling` |
| No files or unclear | `general` |

Use existing area from step 2 if similar match exists.
</step>

<step name="create_file">
```bash
timestamp=$(date "+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M")
date_prefix=$(date "+%Y-%m-%d")
```

Generate slug from title (lowercase, hyphens, no special chars).

Write to `.planning/todos/pending/${date_prefix}-${slug}.md`
</step>

<step name="update_state">
If `.planning/STATE.md` exists:

1. Count todos: `ls .planning/todos/pending/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l`
2. Update "### Pending Todos" under "## Accumulated Context"
</step>

<step name="jj_commit">
Commit the todo and any updated state:

```bash
jj commit -m "docs: capture todo - [title]"
```
</step>

<step name="confirm">
```
Todo saved: .planning/todos/pending/[filename]

  [title]
  Area: [area]
  Files: [count] referenced
