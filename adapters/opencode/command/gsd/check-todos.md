</objective>

<context>
@.planning/STATE.md
@.planning/ROADMAP.md
</context>

<process>

<step name="check_exist">
```bash
TODO_COUNT=$(ls .planning/todos/pending/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
echo "Pending todos: $TODO_COUNT"
```

If count is 0:
```
No pending todos.

Todos are captured during work sessions with /gsd:add-todo.

Would you like to:

1. Continue with current phase (/gsd:progress)
2. Add a todo now (/gsd:add-todo)
```

Exit.
</step>

<step name="parse_filter">
Check for area filter in arguments:
- `/gsd:check-todos` → show all
- `/gsd:check-todos api` → filter to area:api only
</step>

<step name="list_todos">
```bash
for file in .planning/todos/pending/*.md; do
  created=$(grep "^created:" "$file" | cut -d' ' -f2)
  title=$(grep "^title:" "$file" | cut -d':' -f2- | xargs)
  area=$(grep "^area:" "$file" | cut -d' ' -f2)
  echo "$created|$title|$area|$file"
done | sort
```

Apply area filter if specified. Display as numbered list.
</step>

<step name="handle_selection">
Wait for user to reply with a number.

If valid: load selected todo, proceed.
If invalid: "Invalid selection. Reply with a number (1-[N]) or `q` to exit."
</step>

<step name="load_context">
Read the todo file completely. Display title, area, created date, files, problem, solution sections.
</step>

<step name="offer_actions">
Use AskUserQuestion to offer appropriate actions based on roadmap context.
</step>

<step name="execute_action">
Execute the selected action (work on it, add to phase, create phase, brainstorm, or put it back).
</step>

<step name="jj_commit">
If todo was moved to done/, commit the change:

```bash
jj commit -m "docs: start work on todo - [title]"
```
</step>
