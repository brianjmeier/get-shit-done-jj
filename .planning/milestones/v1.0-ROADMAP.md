# Milestone v1.0: GSD-JJ Initial Release

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-15
**Phases:** 1-3
**Total Plans:** 11

## Overview

Fork GSD to use JJ (Jujutsu) instead of Git, with support for both Claude Code and OpenCode clients. Core priority is getting the atomic commit workflow working perfectly with JJ, then restructuring for dual-client support.

## Phases

### Phase 1: JJ Foundation

**Goal**: Create the JJ equivalent of git-integration.md with patterns for colocated and native repos
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Create jj-integration.md with commit workflow, command mappings, repo detection

**Deliverables:**
- `jj-integration.md` reference document
- JJ command mappings (git → jj)
- Colocated vs native repo detection pattern
- Atomic commit workflow for JJ

### Phase 2: Core Workflows

**Goal**: Update all workflows that touch VCS to use JJ commands
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 6 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Update execute-plan.md workflow (19 git refs → JJ)
- [x] 02-02: Update new-project.md, create-roadmap.md, execute-phase.md
- [x] 02-03: Update complete-milestone.md, plan-phase.md
- [x] 02-04: Update supporting commands (pause-work, check-todos, add-todo, remove-phase)
- [x] 02-05: Update remaining workflows (research, verify, debug, map-codebase)
- [x] 02-06: Update templates, deprecate git-integration.md

**Deliverables:**
- execute-plan.md workflow and command (19 git refs → JJ)
- new-project.md, create-roadmap.md, execute-phase.md (project lifecycle)
- complete-milestone.md, plan-phase.md (milestone and planning commits)
- Supporting commands: pause-work, check-todos, add-todo, remove-phase
- Remaining workflows: research, verify, debug, map-codebase, etc.
- Templates updated, git-integration.md deprecated

### Phase 3: Adapter Layer

**Goal**: Restructure for shared core + client-specific adapters, merge OpenCode patterns
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Audit shared core paths, create adapter architecture reference
- [x] 03-02: Create OpenCode adapter with ported commands
- [x] 03-03: Create unified installer with client detection
- [x] 03-04: Documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING)

**Deliverables:**
- Shared core (workflows, references, templates)
- Claude Code adapter (commands/gsd/*.md)
- OpenCode adapter (adapters/opencode/)
- Single installer with client detection
- npm package configuration

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Replace git entirely (no fallback) — cleaner codebase, JJ-native experience
- Shared core + adapters — avoids duplication between Claude Code and OpenCode
- Support colocated + native JJ — flexibility for different project setups
- jj git push/fetch for remotes — GitHub/GitLab compatibility
- Use `jj commit` shorthand for brevity (equivalent to `jj describe + jj new`)
- Thin adapters handle only argument parsing and path resolution; rich core handles workflows

**Issues Resolved:**
- All 19 git references in execute-plan.md replaced with JJ equivalents
- All workflows updated to use JJ auto-tracking (no staging steps)
- 100 @~/.claude/ references verified as intentional runtime patterns

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None significant — clean implementation
